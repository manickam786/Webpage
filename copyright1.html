    <h1>Copyright Requirements in India</h1>
    <p>Copyright is a vital legal protection for creators in India, safeguarding their original works and providing them with exclusive rights over their creations. Understanding the requirements for copyright protection is essential for anyone involved in creative industries.</p>

    <h2>Key Requirements for Copyright Protection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Originality:</strong> The work must be original and demonstrate a degree of creativity. It should not be copied from another source.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixation:</strong> The work must be fixed in a tangible medium, such as a book, painting, software, or recording.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Protection:</strong> In India, copyright protection is automatic upon creation, without the need for registration. However, registration with the Copyright Office offers additional benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Copyright in India generally lasts for the life of the author plus 60 years. For works of joint authorship, it lasts for 60 years from the date of publication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Registration and Notice</h2>
    <p>While registration is not mandatory, it is advisable as it provides legal advantages in case of infringement. Registration can be done through the Copyright Office in India, which simplifies the process of proving ownership. Additionally, including a copyright notice (e.g., Â© [Year] [Your Name/Company]) is recommended to inform the public about your rights.</p>

        <li><strong>Address Proof:</strong> Proof of the applicant's address (e.g., utility bill, bank statement).</li>
        <li><strong>Work Sample:</strong> A copy of the work for which copyright is being claimed (e.g., manuscript, recording, artwork).</li>
        <li><strong>NOC from Co-authors (if applicable):</strong> A No Objection Certificate from co-authors if there are multiple authors.</li>
        <li><strong>Power of Attorney (if applicable):</strong> Required if an agent is applying on behalf of the creator.</li>
        <li><strong>Declaration of Originality:</strong> A signed declaration stating that the work is original and not copied.</li>
    </ul>
